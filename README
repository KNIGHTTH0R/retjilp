Retjilp: Native Auto-retweet bot
--------------------------------
Retjilp logs into your account, and scans all the tweets from your following list
for a set of matching words. If a tweet matches, the tweet will be retweeted.
 
To use this script, you will need to have registered an application with 
http://twitter.com/apps to get a consumer key and secret, and fill these values
in the 'config' file. After having changed the 'config' file, move it to a
dir '.retjilp' in your homedir (i.e. ~/.retjilp).

To start the script, run 'retjilp.rb'

The first time the script is run, it will ask you to authorize the application in
your twitter account. After this is done, the script will automatically log in the
next time it is run.
